# Memory-Card-Game

Welcome to my memory card game. I used the starter code for [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) students and came up with this master piece. Have fun with the interactive card game and let me know if there is any bugs. This project was made with HTML, CSS, and JAVA.

Cheers!

# How-To-Play

Once a card flipped over in the game, the game timer starts and try to get as many matches as possible before mismatching happens and the star rating will drop to fewer stars. There is 8 matches to achieve and you can restard the game at any point if anyone shall wish. In the score panel the game keeps track of how many moves are made and a person could see how well one is doing. Enjoy!
